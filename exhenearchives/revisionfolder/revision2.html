<h3> HTML/CSS and JavaScript </h3>
<p>I would like to learn HTML/CSS and Javascript profusely as I have recently taken some interest on Web Development and it would be a nice miscellaneous skillset to have.</p>

<div class="typescript">
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>Learning this after JavaScript is important to me since it's also object oriented, is one abstraction higher and can be translated to Lua. I plan to use <a href="https://github.com/roblox-ts">roblox-ts</a> to write less code for the same results on Lua.</p>

<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>PHP is a back end web development programming language that I also want to learn as I would want to know how to make my own site from top to bottom.</p>

<div class="python3">
<h3>Python 3</h3>
<p>Python 3 is a very useful language that I would also like to learn, mainly for small game development projects I would like to focus on during the next year.</p>

<h3>Lua</h3>
<p>I would want to learn this specific language to script on Roblox Studio, since building and scripting on the platform is interesting to me. I may or may not learn Python before Lua, or vice versa, but I will get to both of them.</p>
