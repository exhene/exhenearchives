<h1> Programming Languages I would like to learn </h1>
    <p> I am putting this list of programming languages I would like to learn, as its good practice to develop and maintain an HTML file. I will update this list constantly as I develop new skills. I am currently going through HTML/CSS and I see myself starting JavaScript and TypeScript soon. </p>

<h3> HTML/CSS and JavaScript </h3>
<p>I would like to learn HTML/CSS and Javascript profusely as I have recently taken some interest on Web Development and it would be a nice miscellaneous skillset to have.</p>

<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>Learning this after Javascript is important to me since it's also object oriented, is one abstraction higher and can be translated to Lua. I plan to use <a href="https://github.com/roblox-ts">roblox-ts</a> to write less code for the same results on Lua.</p>

<h3>Python 3</h3>
<p>Python 3 is a very useful language that I would also like to learn, mainly for small game development projects I would like to focus on during the next year.</p>

<h3>Lua</h3>
<p>I would want to learn this specific language to script on Roblox Studio, since building and scripting on the platform is interesting to me. I may or may not learn Python before Lua, or vice versa, but I will get to both of them.</p>

<h4>I yet have to do research on the other languages to set a specific goal on what I would want to accomplish using them, for now, I will stick to my current learning curve and update this as I progress, also please enjoy this random table. </h4>
